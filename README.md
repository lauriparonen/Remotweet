# Remotweet

A simple Python bot for tweeting without needing to open the Twitter client.
Also changes the device name from which the tweet is sent - this is the name of your application on the Twitter dev portal. Come up with a good one!

INSTRUCTIONS:

Input your API access keys to the text file entitled "twitterkeys.txt" in the following order:
	1. API key
	2. Secret API key
	3. Access token
	4. Secret access token.

The tweets are written into a text file entitled "Tweet.txt".
The program reads this text file, prints out the character count of the tweet, and asks the user for confirmation before the tweet is sent.
 
If the character count exceeds 280, the program prints out an error message containing the number of excess characters.
